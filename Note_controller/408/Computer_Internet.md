### Chap1
First, it explores the requirements that different applications and different communities of people place on the network. 
Second, it introduces the idea of a network architecture, which lays the foundation for the rest of the book. 
Third, it introduces some of the key elements in the implementation of computer networks. 
Finally, it identifies the key metrics that are used to evaluate the performance of computer networks.
### 1.2 Requirements
An application programmer would list the services that his or her application needs: for example, a guarantee that each message the application sends will be delivered without error within a certain amount of time or the ability to switch gracefully among different connections to the network as the user moves around.

A network operator would list the characteristics of a system that is easy to administer and manage: for example, in which faults can be easily isolated, new devices can be added to the network and configured correctly, and it is easy to account for usage.

A network designer would list the properties of a cost-effective design: for example, that network resources are efficiently utilized and fairly allocated to different users. Issues of performance are also likely to be important.
* Scalable Connectivity
A system that is designed to support growth to an arbitrarily large size is said to scale. Using the Internet as a model, this book addresses the challenge of scalability
