1. Any node, whether it is a host or a router, first tries to establish whether it is connected to the same physical network as the destination. 
2. The main issue is that IP datagrams contain IP addresses, but the physical interface hardware on the host or router to which you want to send the datagram only understands the addressing scheme of that particular network.
3.  Thus, it is not possible for the IP address to be configured once into a host when it is manufactured, since that would imply that the manufacturer knew which hosts were going to end up on which networks, and it would mean that a host, once connected to one network, could never move to another.
4.   To make a private network virtual, the leased transmission lines—which are not shared with any other corporations—would be replaced by some sort of shared network.
5.   For example, when a radio station is broadcast over the Internet, the same data must be sent to all the hosts where a user has tuned in to that station.
6. Only after this connection establishment phase is over do the two sides begin sending data.
