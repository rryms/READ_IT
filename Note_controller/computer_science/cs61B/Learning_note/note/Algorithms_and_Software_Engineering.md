# phase 3
* Algorithms
* 3 software engineering lectures
optional textbook---A Philosophy of Software Design
Assignments in this phase:
* Finish Gitlet.
First chance at software engineering and a little design.
* Project 3: Build Your Own World.
Second chance to do some software engineering.
Lots more design practice.
Youâ€™ll decide your own task and approach.
Partner project, so try to find a partner soon.
