# [lab1](https://cs61c.org/su24/labs/lab01/)
* Goals
    * Practice with pointers, strings, and structs
    * Learning basic debugging skills: compiler warnings, assert statement,and GDB

## Pointers

```c
int main(){
    int my_var =20;
    int* my_var_p;
    my_var_p = &my_var;
}

```
* Pointers to Stack vs. Heap

## Arrays
An array is a fixed length data structure that can hold one or more elements of the same type. Unlike lists, arrays do not resize automatically when you add an element.

In C, arrays are represented as a pointer to the first element. Each element of the array is stored in memory and they are stored in contiguous memory locations (side by side). Because arrays are represented only with a pointer to the first element, the pointer itself is not enough to deduce the length of the array. If you need to keep track of the length of an array, you must use another variable.

* Pointer Arithmetic
When performing pointer arithmetic, C automatically accounts for the type of the pointer and adds the correct number of bytes. For example, if you write **ptr + 5**, C will not always add 5 to ptr. Instead, C will add 5 times the size of the datatype that **ptr** points to. If **ptr** was an **int** and **ints** take up 4 bytes in memory, **ptr + 5** adds 20 to the address held in **ptr**.

```c
int array[6]; //request a array sized 6;
array[1] = 3234;
```

## Strings

In C, strings are represented as an array of **char**s. Strings are a special type of **char** arrays because they always end in a null terminator (**\0**). Recall that arrays in C do not contain any information about their length, so the null terminator allows us to determine when the string ends.

When allocating memory for a string, there must be enough memory to store the characters within the string and the null terminator. Otherwise, you might run into undefined behavior. However, the array could be larger than the string it stores.

C has a library of functions for manipulating strings, such as:

* **strlen**: computes the length of a string by counting the number of characters before a null terminator
* **strcpy**: copies a string from one memory location to another, one character at a time until it reaches a null terminator (the null terminator is copied as well)
