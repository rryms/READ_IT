### The Cornell Note-Taking Method
![cornell note-taking](../../pictures/2024-07-30%2016.08.11.png)
**Note-Taking Area:**: Record lecture as fully and as meaningfully as possible.
**Cue Column**:As you’re taking notes, keep cue column empty. Soon after the lecture, reduce your notes to concise jottings as clues for Reciting, Reviewing, and Reflecting.
**Summaries:**:Sum up each page of your notes in a sentence or two.
This format provides the perfect opportunity for following through with the 5 R’s of note-taking:
1. **Record**
During the lecture, record in the main column as many meaningful facts and ideas as you can. Write legibly.
2. **Reduce**
As soon after as possible, summarize these facts and ideas concisely in the Cue Column. Summarizing clarifies meanings and relationships, reinforces continuity, and strengthens memory.
3. **Recite**
Cover the Note Taking Area, using only your jottings in the Cue Column, say over the facts and ideas of the lecture as fully as you can, not mechanically, but in your own words. Then, verify what you have said.
4. **Reflect**
Draw out opinions from your notes and use them as a starting point for your own reflections on the course and how it relates to your other courses. Reflection will help prevent ideas from being inert and soon forgotten.
5. **Review**
Spend 10 minutes every week in quick review of your notes, and you will retain most of what you have learned.

### Blooms's Taxonomy
* **Knowledge** “involves the recall of specifics and universals, the recall of methods and processes, or the recall of a pattern, structure, or setting.”
* **Comprehension** “refers to a type of understanding or apprehension such that the individual knows what is being communicated and can make use of the material or idea being communicated without necessarily relating it to other material or seeing its fullest implications.”
* **Application** refers to the “use of abstractions in particular and concrete situations.”
* **Analysis** represents the “breakdown of a communication into its constituent elements or parts such that the relative hierarchy of ideas is made clear and/or the relations between ideas expressed are made explicit.”
* **Synthesis** involves the “putting together of elements and parts so as to form a whole.”
* **Evaluation** engenders “judgments about the value of material and methods for given purposes.”
* **Create** Produce new or original work

K: What do I Know
W: What do I Want to know
L: What have I Learnt

Learn -> Know -> Comprehensive knowledge 
搭积木

小细节要落到实处，并不是孤立的表现
对文本的把握 -> Paraphrase ->word, paragraph

Why learning English as a unit?
如同学习中文，对词的感觉往往是文风的反应，从整体的角度学习英语，把单词当作故事中的角色，有的见的多，有的性格鲜明，有的因为对比认识，更有味道.
